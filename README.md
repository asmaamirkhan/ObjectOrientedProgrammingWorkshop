# Introduction to Programming Workshop
A repo that contains details about the workshop that I have joined as a technical trainer at Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa

> Workshop Date: 02.04.2019 📅

## Summary
As Computer Club at Istanbul University (İÜBK), a 2-hour workshop was organized with the participation of 56 students on 02.04.2019 within the context of the "Introduction to Programming" course.
I joined the workshop as a trainer, I explained the important concepts of "Object Oriented Programming" and did code exercises about these concepts.

## What have we done?
We have implemented the class of **Matrix** with its functions operations in C++.

Technically, to be able to implement it we have used object oriented programming concepts :sparkles:, such as _classes_, _class members_ and since matrix operations are relatively complicated we improved problem solving skill as well.  

## Which concepts have we mentioned? 
* Class Definition
* Class Member Functions & Class Access Modifiers
* Class Constructor, Destructor and Copy Constructor
* Friend Functions
* _this_ Pointer
* Operator Overloading
* Inhertance
* Data Encapsulation
* Exception Handling
